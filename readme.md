Ever want to seek forward a video for only a few seconds? Well you can actually do it easily. This script does that. 

You can use `ctrl + \` to seek forward and `ctrl + ]` to seek backward for 3 seconds. You can easily change the key and time easily in the script itself. I have leave a few comments in the script to explain how it works.
